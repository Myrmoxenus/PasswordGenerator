Homework 3 - Password Generator

Created a password generator that's operable from the provided html. I tried creating something that would verify at the end whether or not the final randomly generated password contained all character types but wasn't able to finish. I think I got pretty close though, so I might update it later in the week.

Users press the generate password button and then receive a series of prompts allowing them to choose which types of characters they want to be included. Input is restricted to between 8 and 128 characters and input must be an integer.

For reasons I am unable to diagnose, on my desktop the image assosciated with "Social Media Marketing" doesn't appear to load. It is however loading correctly for me when I use other computers. Hopefully it is behaving functionally for you as well.
