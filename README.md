Homework 3 - Password Generator

Created a password generator that's operable from the provided html. I also added a feature at the end that would throw away and regenerate passwords that did not contain at least once instance of every desired character.

Users press the generate password button and then receive a series of prompts allowing them to choose which types of characters they want to be included. Input is restricted to between 8 and 128 characters and input must be an integer. 

Application deployed at: https://myrmoxenus.github.io/homework3/
