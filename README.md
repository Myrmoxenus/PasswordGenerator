Homework 3 - Password Generator

Created a password generator that's operable from the provided html. As a side addition I'm currently trying to add a feature that will check the final password for the absence of any of the desired characters and regenerate the password if those are missing.

Users press the generate password button and then receive a series of prompts allowing them to choose which types of characters they want to be included. Input is restricted to between 8 and 128 characters and input must be an integer. 

Application deployed at: https://myrmoxenus.github.io/homework3/
